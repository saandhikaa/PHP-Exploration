# PHP Exploration

Welcome to the PHP Exploration repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring PHP programming, focusing on basic code, basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure. The materials and code in this repository are based on the tutorials provided by the WPU (Web Programming UNPAS) YouTube channel.

## Demo

To see a live demo of the PHP projects implemented in this repository, please visit the following link: `coming soon`.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- [`basic-code`](/basic-code): This directory contains basic PHP code snippets that cover fundamental concepts and syntax. It includes examples for variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and more.

- [`oop-concept`](/oop-concept): This directory contains examples and exercises related to basic object-oriented programming concepts in PHP. It covers topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

- [`mvc-application`](/mvc-application): This directory showcases a simple implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using PHP. It provides a basic structure for separating business logic, presentation, and data access.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/saandhikaa/PHP-Exploration
    ```

2. Refer to the `basic-code` directory for basic PHP code snippets. These examples cover fundamental concepts and syntax, allowing you to practice and solidify your PHP skills.

3. Explore the `oop-concept` directory to learn about different OOP concepts in PHP. Each example is provided with comments and explanations for better understanding.

4. Check out the `mvc-application` directory to see a basic implementation of the MVC pattern in PHP. Follow the comments and directory structure to get a grasp of the separation of concerns.

5. Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and further enhance your PHP skills!
